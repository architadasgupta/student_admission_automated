Manual document verification creates bottlenecks and consumes staff time.
Eligibility assessments are prone to inconsistency and human error.
Application processing typically takes over 48 hours—too slow for today’s standards.
Applicants receive limited transparency about their application status.
 Our Solution Overview
The system introduces a four-layer intelligent architecture to automate, accelerate, and refine the student admission process.
 1. Document Intelligence Layer
Hybrid OCR: Combines traditional OCR (e.g., Tesseract) with AI-based interpretation for accuracy.
Smart Input Handling: Supports both scanned and digital documents.
Adaptive Preprocessing: Cleans and enhances poor-quality scans for reliable extraction.
 2. Decision Engine (Multi-Agent AI)
Validation Agent: Checks for document authenticity and data completeness.
Eligibility Agent: Matches applicant profiles against program requirements.
Shortlisting Agent: Recommends candidates based on academic fit and historical trends.
Loan Processing Agent: Evaluates financial eligibility and support options.
Feedback Agent: goes through the entire output generated by the validation agent, eligibility agent shortlisting agent, and loan processing agent to give a personalized and detailed feedback about the application status
PDF generator Agent: creates a PDF for the feedback generated
3. Knowledge Base
Vector Database: Uses semantic indexing for fast, relevant search results.
Applicant Profiling: Learns from past patterns to suggest fair decisions.
Continuous Learning: Improves decision logic with every cycle.
4. Reporting & Feedback System
Dynamic PDF Generation: Automatically creates reports, decision letters, and summaries.
Real-Time Status Tracking: Keeps applicants informed every step of the way.
Transparent Feedback: Explains decisions with clarity and fairness.
